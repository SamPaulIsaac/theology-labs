# Theology Labs

**Theology Labs** is a structured knowledge base focused on theological studies, starting with a categorized and organized presentation of biblical scriptures. It is designed for learners, educators, and developers seeking to explore theology through structured text and tooling-friendly formats.

## 📚 Project Overview

This project curates scriptural content into clear `.adoc` (AsciiDoc) documents—offering foundational data for in-depth study of both the Old and New Testaments. It also sets the stage for future theological expansions including commentary, themes, historical context, and doctrine.

## 🗂️ Contents

The current scope includes the following files:

| File Name                          | Description                                                |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `bibleIntro.adoc`                 | High-level introduction to the Bible and its structure.    |
